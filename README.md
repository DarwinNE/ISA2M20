# ISA2M20
Adapter for 8-bit ISA card for the Olivetti M20

This project is dedicated to an adapter that allows to connect 8 bit ISA boards to
the bus of an Olivetti M20. Yes, we are talking about 1982 technology.
That may allow to do some nice stuff on the M20 as long as you are able to write the
software for the cards you want to attach.
